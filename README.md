# AusSoilsDSM

*Under Development*

This repository will hopefully deliver a goto resource for perfroming digital soil mapping in any situation. It will contain:
- Workflows for doing digital soil mapping
- Code examples of fitting different types of geospatial models
- Code snippets of useful 'data science' workflows
- Documentation to guide new and seasoned users through the available code.

It is envisaged that this repository will be a public resource where people can both try use the provided resources and submit additional code and documentation.
