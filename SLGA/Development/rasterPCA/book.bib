Civilizations all around the world showed various levels of soil knowledge by the 4th century AD, including irrigation, the use of terraces to control erosion, various ways of improving soil fertility, and ways to create productive artificial soils. Early soils knowledge was largely based on observations of nature; experiments to test theories were not conducted. Many famous scientists, for example, Francis Bacon, Robert Boyle, Charles Darwin, and Leonardo da Vinci worked on soils issues. Soil science did not become a true science, however, until the 19th century with the development of genetic soil science, led by Vasilii V. Dokuchaev. In the 20th century, soil science moved beyond its agricultural roots and soil information is now used in residential development, the planning of highways, building foundations, septic systems, wildlife management, environmental management, and many other applications in addition to agriculture.},

	abstract = {Over the last 10??years Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) has emerged as a credible alternative to traditional soil mapping. However, \{DSM\} should not be seen as an end in itself, but rather as a technique for providing data and information for a new framework for soil assessment which we call Digital Soil Assessment (DSA). Although still somewhat fluid, a procedural framework for \{DSM\} and \{DSA\} with its links and feedbacks is set out diagrammatically and discussed. A significant advantage inter alia of \{DSM\} over conventional methods in this context is the intended provision of estimates of predictor uncertainties. \{DSA\} comprises three main processes: (1) soil attribute space inference, (2) evaluation of soil functions and the threats to soils, and (3) risk assessment and the development of strategies for soil protection. Digital Soil Risk Assessment (DSRA) consists of integrating political, social, economical parameters and general environmental threats to \{DSA\} outputs for building, modelling and testing some scenarios about environmental perspectives. The procedure as a whole is illustrated using an example.},

	abstract = {The Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia (SLGA) is the first continental version of the GlobalSoilMap concept and the first nationally consistent, fine spatial resolution set of continuous soil attributes with Australia-wide coverage. The SLGA relies on digital soil mapping methods and integrates historical soil data, new measurement with spectroscopic sensors, novel spatial modelling and a web-service delivery architecture. The SLGA provides soil, regolith and landscape estimates at the centre point of 3 arcsecond grid cells ( 90??????90??m) across Australia. At each point, there are estimates of 11 soil attributes and confidence intervals for each estimate to a depth of 2??m or less, depth of regolith and a set of terrain descriptors. The information system also includes a library of mid-infrared spectra, an inference engine that allows estimation of additional soil parameters and an information model that enables users to access the system via web services. The explicit mapping of depth, bulk density and coarse fragments allows estimation of material stores and fluxes on a volumetric basis. The SLGA therefore has immediate applications in carbon, nitrogen and water process modelling. The map of regolith depth will find immediate application to studies of vadose zone processes, including solute transport, groundwater and nutrient fluxes beyond the root zone. Landscape attributes at 1 and 3 arcseconds are useful for a wide spectrum of ecological, hydrological and broader environmental applications. The SLGA can be accessed at no cost from www.csiro.au/soil-and-landscape-grid. It is managed and delivered as part of the Australian Soil Resource Information System (ASRIS).},

	abstract = {Abstract Digital soil assessment (DSA) is the application of interpretations to digital soil mapping (DSM). Since 2010, an operational \{DSA\} program has been underway in Tasmania, Australia, primarily for the assessment of agricultural land suitability for 20 different crops in newly commissioned irrigation schemes. This involves development of functional soil attribute and climate grids, initially undertaken in two pilot areas totalling 70,000 ha, with comprehensive soil sampling and temperature sensor networks. Through the Tasmanian State Government ???Water for Profit Program???, this pilot land resource assessment has become operational and applied to the entire State (68,401 km2), covering a total of 19 irrigation schemes. Using a combination of newly collected and legacy soil data and a suite of spatial explanatory covariates, a total of 218 80 m resolution 3D soil attribute grids were produced using the digital mapping approach, together with quantified prediction uncertainties. These grids have contributed to the ???Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia??? and the ???GlobalSoilMap??? projects. Using a similar approach, functional climate grids were generated for chill-hours, growing degree-days and frost risk. The digital soil and climate grids were applied to pre-defined enterprise suitability rulesets to produce 20 different maps of enterprise suitability, including opium poppies, and a range of perennial horticultural, cereal and vegetable crops, uploaded to a publically accessible spatial internet portal (Land Information Services Tasmania; LISTmap), which includes functionality to identify soil and climate limitations, as an indication of potential land management inputs. The suitability surfaces provide a regional indication of potential areas to expand or diversify into a range of cropping enterprises. However, some informative supplementary products were also developed to provide an overall spatial guide to the more versatile agricultural areas. This included an enterprise versatility index (by combining all suitability surfaces to identify areas more suited to more enterprises); and application of individual commodity ???financial gross-margins??? to identify the highest-valued agricultural land in terms of earning potential. These products demonstrate the utility of functional soil property grids and the collective capacity of \{DSA\} to answer questions of agricultural potential; this can ensure the appropriate land is targeted for appropriate uses to stimulate agricultural markets and maintain food security.},

	abstract = {Abstract Disaggregation of conventional soil surveys has been identified as a potential source for much of the next generation of model-ready digital soil spatial data. This process aims to apportion vector soil surveys into raster (gridded) representations of the component soils that are often aggregated together in map unit designs. Most soil surveys are published with some description of the soil???landscape relationships that distinguish component soils within map units. We used these descriptions found in the Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) database of Webster and Pocahontas Counties in West Virginia, USA, to build a set of representative training areas for all soil components by using 1-arc second digital elevation data and derived geomorphic indices. These training areas were then used in classification tree ensembles with a more extensive environmental database to transform the original \{SSURGO\} map into a gridded soil series map. We created underlying prediction frequency surfaces from the models that can be used for creating continuous representations of soil class and property distributions. Disaggregation models matched training sets in 71\%???74\% of pixels and matched components in original \{SSURGO\} map units in 56\%???65\% of the study area. We evaluated both the original \{SSURGO\} data and our models using 87 independent pedons not used in model building. Validation pedons matched components in \{SSURGO\} map units at 39\% of sites, but in map units that only included one named component (as opposed to multiple soils that could be matched to validation pedons) only 27\% of the sites matched. Disaggregation predictions matched validation pedon classes 22???24\% of the time using nearest neighbor spatial matches, and these rates increased to 39???44\% for correct predictions within a 60-meter radius of the pedon. To characterize uncertainty, we compared relative ensemble prediction frequency (probability) of final hardened model classes at validation sites. Sites with correct predictions had generally higher prediction frequencies; which lead us to use them to create an uncertainty model. Uncertainty was calculated by determining the rate of correct predictions at validation sites within different intervals of prediction frequencies using nearest neighbor validation results. We were able to discern four uncertainty classes with values of 7\%, 18\%, 20\% and 43\%, which we called ???ground truth probabilities???. We present the methods to create these models as a specific example of how disaggregation techniques may be used to aid in updating national soil survey inventories.},

	abstract = {Summary Recent studies show that soil animal count data are characterized by the presence of excess zeros and overdispersion, which violate the assumptions of standard statistical tests. Despite this, analyses have consisted of mainly non-parametric tests and log-normal least square regression (i.e. ANOVA). Failure to accommodate zero inflation in count data can result in biased estimation of ecological effects jeopardizing the integrity of the scientific inference. The objective of this study was to compare statistical models for the analysis of soil animal count data and suggest appropriate methods for estimating abundance. The log-normal regression model, linear mixed model (LMM), standard Poisson, Poisson with correction for overdispersion (PCO), negative binomial distribution (NBD), the zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) and zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) models were compared using 12 count data sets of earthworms, millipedes, centipedes, beetles, ants and termites from soils under the miombo woodland and agroforestry systems in eastern Zambia. The \{NBD\} with covariates gave a better description of the data in nine out of 12 cases than did the standard Poisson, \{ZIP\} and ZINB. The \{ZIP\} and \{ZINB\} models with covariates gave the best description of earthworm counts from the miombo and millipede counts from agroforestry, respectively. In all cases, the \{ZIP\} model was better than the standard Poisson model. The \{ZINB\} was inferior to the \{NBD\} except for earthworm counts from the miombo and millipede counts in agroforestry. Significance tests based on the PCO, ZIP, \{NBD\} and \{ZINB\} were more conservative than those based on the standard Poisson model. The 95\% confidence intervals computed using the PCO, ZIP, \{NBD\} and \{ZINB\} were also wider than those computed using least squares, \{LMM\} and assuming Poisson distribution. It is concluded that for the comparison among habitat types, land-use categories or treatments, the NBD, \{ZIP\} and \{ZINB\} perform better than the log-normal and Poisson models. Considering the excess-zero problem and significant deviation of soil animal counts from the assumptions of normality and homoscedcity, the log-normal regression model is inappropriate. Therefore, routine application of the log-normal regression model and non-parametric tests for analysis of soil animal count data with many zeros should be discouraged.},
